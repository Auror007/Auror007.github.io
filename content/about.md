Greetings, traveller of the web. Congratulations, you have landed on the personal blog of Parth. Here, I will be posting
all things related to security, some dev stuff and non-tech related topics as well. Feel free to contact me or give feedback
by using the contact links in the websites. 

When I am not staring at screen questioning my life decisions or on the verge of throwing the monitor out 
of window during debugging sessions, I like to click bird pictures and gaze at stars.
